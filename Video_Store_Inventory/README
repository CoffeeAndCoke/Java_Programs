Manage a Video Store Inventory

Problem:
Write a Java program that will allow a user to manage the inventory of a store that sells DVDs.
The inventory for the video store will contain the following information for each movie (each title) in the inventory:

SKU (stock-keeping unit, an integer, must be unique)
quantity (number of copies in inventory, greater than or equal to 0) 
price (dollars and cents, greater than 0)
title (may contain spaces)

The program should offer the user a menu with the following options:

1. Add a movie to the inventory (prompt user for input values in this order: sku,
quantity, price, title).
2. Remove a movie from the inventory (by sku).
3. Display the information for a movie (given the sku).
4. Display the inventory in a table (in any order).
5. Quit

The program should perform the operation selected by number and then re-display the menu. If the operation fails (i.e. invalid input or attempt to remove a movie not in the inventory) your program should display an error message and return to the menu.

Do not change the menu numbers associated with the operations.

Your program should store the inventory in a file between executions of the program, so that when the program is run again it will start up with the same inventory contents as when it last terminated (use serialization!). Your program must run even if the file is not present (initial inventory is empty).
